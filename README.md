It took me quite a lot of trial and error to get my ds4 to work in games in wine, so I figured I might as well upload the configs and tools that I needed to get it to work.

Run [ds4drv][ds4drv] as root using the config and copy everything in the xbox360cemu directory to the directory of the windows binaries you're running.

[x360ce][x360ce] doesn't list a license, so if it becomes problematic that I have these DLLs in here then I will remove them and only include the config file.
